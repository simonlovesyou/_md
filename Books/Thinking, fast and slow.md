summary: '"Thinking, Fast and Slow" is all about how two systems ‚Äî intuition and slow thinking ‚Äî shape our judgment, and how we can effectively tap into both. Using principles of behavioral economics, Kahneman walks us through how to think and avoid mistakes in situations when the stakes are really high.'
