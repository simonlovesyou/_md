**Expertise-induced amnesia** refers to when individuals become so skilled at a task that their execution of this task becomes automatic, to the point where they may not consciously recall the details of the task performance. This can lead them to overlook more efficient methods or innovations because they're operating largely on autopilot.

**Entrenchment**, on the other hand, is a concept where experts in a particular domain may become so set in their ways that they are resistant to new ideas or ways of doing things. Their deep knowledge and established methods can lead to a kind of cognitive rigidity, where they might stick to familiar tools and strategies even when better ones are available.
