LLUM's history began in 1891, when wholesaler [Anton Carl Illum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Carl_Illum "Anton Carl Illum") opened a store specializing in sewing items and dress accessories in Østergade across from ILLUM's current location. The target group was the city's fine ladies. The business grew over the years and in 1899 moved to its current location. After Illum's death in 1938, the company was inherited by his son Svend Illum.
