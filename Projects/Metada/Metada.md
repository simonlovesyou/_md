Metada is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to store and manage metadata for their Git commits. The tool allows users to track different types of metadata, such as test coverage, language coverage, build output size, performance, and more.

The tool is designed to work both in local development and through a web interface, allowing users to view and manage their metadata in real-time. Users can store multiple measurements for the same metadata type and commit, and choose how to handle conflicts when adding or modifying measurements.

The Metada provides a simple and intuitive CLI interface that allows users to create a new database to store metadata, add, update, or delete metadata for a specific commit, show metadata for a specific commit, and list all commits with metadata.
